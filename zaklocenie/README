The component zaklocenie connects to the server using the 'requests' Python
library. In order to flood the server with data, it sends in the loop two types
of messages:
    * messages updating the input of the dynamic process. In every loop
      5 messages are sent, each with different number of inputs: 
      between 1 and 5. 
 
    * messages to non-defined route.
